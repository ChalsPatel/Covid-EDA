## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project loads COVID-19 datasets, cleans the data, and uses simple visualizations to answer questions like:
- How did cases and deaths evolve over time?
- What correlations exist between variables?
- How do different countries or regions compare?

All plots are made using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
